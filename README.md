There is currently no new app developer yet. If somebody is making a PR, I will merge and publish it to the appstore.

# Zone Luminance

This app provides flow conditions where you can set desired luminance for a zone. It supports lowest, highest and average luminance for a zone.
By using this app your flows become independent of luminance devices, Sso you can add or remove luminance devices without changing flows.
